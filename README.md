# Collaborative Scheduling App

This web application allows users to **create private scheduling rooms**, **invite others**, and **find the best date for an event** collaboratively. It was built using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Key Features

- âœ¨ Users can **create custom "rooms"** for events.
- ðŸ“¨ Room invitations can be shared via:
  - **QR Code**
  - **Email**
  - **Unique room code**
- ðŸ“… Inside each room, participants can:
  - Access a **shared calendar**
  - Mark dates as **Available**, **Unavailable**, or **Maybe**
- âœ… Once all participants have submitted their availability, the app:
  - **Automatically finds the best matching date/time**
  - **Notifies everyone via:**
    - Email
    - Discord server or direct messages

This tool is ideal for coordinating events like meetings, game nights, trips, or any group activity that requires scheduling.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
